This game is PAC-MAN but with some little changes.
There are 3 documents containing the code that runs this game: game.py, map.py, and sprites.py.
To play the game, open and run game.py. You may need to open the other files as well for pathing to work. I'm not sure how this behaves on windows.

THIS GAME IS HARD!
But what fun is an easy game?

Controls:
W - GO UP
S - GO DOWN
D - GO RIGHT
A - GO LEFT
P - PAUSE/UNPAUSE

The objective is to eat the food scattered around the map. Each time all the food is eaten, the difficulty, the speed at which you and the enemies move, increases slightly.

There are three enemies with two behaviors each. The enemies will alternate between hunting the player and going towards respective corners of the map. If an enemy collides with you, the game will end. You will have to plan ahead to avoid getting trapped.
There are no power ups.
You can go to the empty spaces on the right and left of the map to jump to the other side of the map, but the enemies cannot.
